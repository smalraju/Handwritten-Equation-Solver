# Handwritten-Equation-Solver

During the second semester of 3rd year, I was a part of the project Handwritten Digit Recognition System which classifies the handwritten numbers into its respective class ranging from 0-9.This semester, as an extension to the previous project, I am in a process of developing a system which solves Handwritten Arithmetic Expressions. 
Methods of CNN is used to train the data , which contains numbers from 0-9 and arithmetic operators ( such as + , - , *, / ) hence classification of elements is done into 13 classes. 
Robust handwritten character recognition is a tricky job in the area of image processing. Among all the problem handwritten mathematical expression recognition is one of the complicated issue in the area of computer vision research. 

Segmentation and classification of specific character makes the task more difficult. In this paper a group of handwritten quadratic equation as well as a single quadratic equation are considered to recognize and make a solution for those equation. 
Horizontal compact projection analysis and combined connected component analysis methods are used for segmentation. For classification of specific character we apply Convolutional Neural Network. Each of the correct detection, character string operation is used for the solution of the equation. 
Finally the experimental results shows the great effectiveness of our proposed system.
